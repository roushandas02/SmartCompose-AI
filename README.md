# SmartCompose AI

SmartCompose AI is an intelligent email assistant that helps you draft professional, context-aware replies with minimal effort. It combines a Chrome extension, a React frontend, and a Spring Boot backend integrated with Gemini AI to deliver fast, customized email responses.

## 1. Chrome Extension

The Chrome extension integrates directly with Gmail. It injects a **‚ÄúGenerate Reply‚Äù** button into the compose box, enabling you to instantly create AI-powered replies based on the current email thread. It also includes a popup panel to configure tone, style, and default templates.

## 2. React Frontend

The React frontend application allows users to:
- Paste the original email text.
- Select the desired tone (formal, friendly, concise, etc.).
- Provide an optional custom prompt.
- Generate a polished reply with one click.

It also includes login and signup pages connected to the backend for secure access.

## 3. Spring Boot Backend

The backend is built with Spring Boot and provides REST APIs for:
- Generating email replies by sending input to the Gemini API and returning the response.
- Handling user authentication with JWT-based signin and signup endpoints.


### üîë Authentication Flow

**Register User**

POST /register
- Stores hashed password in MySQL.

**Login**

POST /login
- Validates credentials.

Returns JWT access token.

Access Protected APIs
Attach **Authorization:** Bearer <token> header.

JWT is validated in a custom filter.

**Role-Based Access**

Endpoints can be secured by roles (hasAuthority("ADMIN")).


It is designed for secure, high-performance integration with both the extension and frontend.

## 4. mySQL Database

This project has a robust Spring Boot backend application that implements secure authentication and authorization workflows. It leverages **MySQL** as the primary relational database and uses **Hibernate** as the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework to manage entity persistence and database interactions seamlessly.The default ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) used by Spring Data JPA is Hibernate.  User credentials, roles, and related metadata are stored securely with support for **password hashing** and **token-based authentication.** The backend exposes RESTful APIs for user registration, login, and access control. With a clean, modular architecture, this project is ideal for building scalable services that require reliable user management, secure data persistence, and efficient ORM capabilities.

You don‚Äôt need to extend or implement any specific Hibernate classes or interfaces to use it. Simply use standard JPA annotations like @Entity, @Id, and @Column in your entity classes. Hibernate works as the JPA provider behind the scenes, handling persistence automatically.
